# Technical Implementation Notes (September 2025)

## Benchmark Methodology

### Problem Resolution
The initial benchmarks showed unrealistic performance differences (hundreds of thousands of times) due to compiler optimizations. This was resolved by:

1. **Volatile Variables**: Using `volatile` keyword in C to prevent optimization
2. **Result Accumulation**: Accumulating results instead of overwriting them
3. **Proper Sink Variables**: Ensuring all computations contribute to final result

### Implementation Details

#### C Implementation
```c
volatile uint64_t sink = 0;  // Prevents optimization
for (int r = 0; r < reps; r++) {
    // ... computation ...
    sink += result;  // Accumulate, don't overwrite
}
```

#### Go Implementation
```go
var sink uint64 = 0  // Accumulate results
for r := 0; r < reps; r++ {
    // ... computation ...
    sink += result  // Prevent optimization
}
```

#### Rust Implementation
```rust
let mut sink: u64 = 0;  // Accumulate results
for _r in 0..reps {
    // ... computation ...
    sink += result;  // Prevent optimization
}
```

## Compilation Settings

- **C**: `gcc -O2` with runtime library
- **Go**: `go build` with standard optimization
- **Rust**: `cargo build --release` with full optimization
- **Tenge**: Generated C compiled with `gcc -O2`

## System Specifications

- **OS**: macOS (darwin 24.6.0)
- **Architecture**: Apple Silicon (MacBook Air)
- **Compiler**: clang/gcc with -O2 optimization
- **Memory**: Sufficient for all benchmarks
- **Network**: Enabled but not affecting CPU-bound tasks

## Validation Methods

1. **Energy Conservation**: N-Body simulation energy values validated
2. **Sorting Correctness**: Array sorting verified
3. **Fibonacci Accuracy**: Mathematical correctness confirmed
4. **Multiple Runs**: Consistent results across multiple executions
5. **Compiler Output**: Generated assembly inspected for optimization

## Performance Analysis

### Fibonacci Benchmark
- Simple arithmetic operations
- C shows best performance due to minimal overhead
- Other languages show small but consistent overhead

### Sorting Benchmark
- Complex algorithm with memory access patterns
- Rust's excellent performance likely due to:
  - Zero-cost abstractions
  - Efficient memory management
  - Optimized standard library
- Tenge shows competitive performance with generated C

### N-Body Simulation
- Computationally intensive with floating-point operations
- Tenge's superior performance suggests:
  - Excellent C code generation
  - Optimal memory layout
  - Efficient loop optimization
- Demonstrates Tenge's strength in numerical computing

## Conclusion

The corrected benchmarks provide realistic performance comparisons showing that Tenge is highly competitive with native languages, particularly excelling in computationally intensive tasks.
