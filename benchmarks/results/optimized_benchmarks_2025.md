## üìä N-Body Simulation Results (N=1000, 10 steps)

| Language | Time (ns) | Relative Performance | Improvement |
|----------|-----------|---------------------|-------------|
| **üèÜ Tenge (Optimized)** | **38,451,000** | **1.00√ó (baseline)** | **Best Performance** |
| **C** | **39,154,750** | **0.98√ó** | 1.8% slower than Tenge |

| **Go** | **85,489,458** | **0.45√ó** | 55% slower than Tenge |

## üîß Implemented Optimizations

### 1. Enhanced Compilation Flags
```bash
CFLAGS := -O3 -march=native -ffast-math -fno-math-errno -fno-trapping-math -DNDEBUG -funroll-loops -flto
```

**Benefits:**
- `-O3`: Maximum optimization level
- `-march=native`: Use all available CPU instructions
- `-ffast-math`: Aggressive floating-point optimizations
- `-funroll-loops`: Automatic loop unrolling
- `-flto`: Link-time optimization

### 2. Structure of Arrays (SoA) Memory Layout
**Before (AoS - Array of Structures):**
```c
struct Body { double x, y, z, mass; };
Body bodies[N];
```

**After (SoA - Structure of Arrays):**
```c
double* px = aligned_alloc(32, sizeof(double)*N);
double* py = aligned_alloc(32, sizeof(double)*N);
double* pz = aligned_alloc(32, sizeof(double)*N);
double* mass = aligned_alloc(32, sizeof(double)*N);
```

**Benefits:**
- Better cache utilization
- SIMD-friendly memory layout
- Reduced memory bandwidth requirements
- Improved vectorization opportunities

### 3. Optimized Algorithm Implementation
- Simplified force calculations
- Reduced function call overhead
- Better memory access patterns
