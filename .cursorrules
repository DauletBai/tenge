# Global guardrails for Cursor in this repository

- All code comments must be in English and must serve as technical documentation only.
- Do not include conversational explanations for the maintainer in code comments.

- Do not break existing builds or benchmarks.
- Prefer additive changes; avoid refactors that alter current behavior unless covered by tests/benches and explicitly approved.
- Preserve existing Kazakh Latin letters, identifiers, and terms used in code.

- When adding features, guard them behind flags or separate targets; keep defaults preserving current behavior and results.
- Keep performance sensitivity in mind; do not add hidden allocations or global locks on hot paths.

- For new modules:
  - Provide minimal docs in English at the top of the file (what, inputs/outputs, complexity).
  - Add unit/smoke tests or a micro-benchmark where applicable.
  - Wire into CI only if it does not increase total runtime by more than +20% unless approved.

- Follow repository conventions:
  - Branch names: feature/*, perf/*, docs/*, chore/*, ci/*.
  - Conventional commits: feat:, perf:, fix:, docs:, chore:, ci:, refactor:, test:, build:.

- Pull requests must include:
  - A clear summary of intent.
  - A note on performance implications (if any).
  - Evidence that `make build` and `benchmarks/run.sh` still pass locally.

- If a change might be risky, create it behind a build tag or a Makefile target that is off by default.

- When asked to output code, prefer full files rather than patches/diffs.
